    "This tutorial teaches you how to combine traditional tick-based agent-based modeling with discrete event simulation using Mesa's `ABMSimulator`. You'll learn when and how to use hybrid models for optimal performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Learning Objectives:**\n",
    "- Understand when to use hybrid ABM-DEVS models vs pure approaches\n",
    "- Master the `ABMSimulator` for integer-time ticks + events\n",
    "- Combine spatial agent movement with event scheduling\n",
    "- Implement an epidemic model with event-based recovery\n",
    "- Benchmark tick-based vs event-based performance\n",
    "- Apply advanced DEVS patterns (cancellation, chaining, dynamic scheduling)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Prerequisites:**\n",
    "- Complete Tutorial 11 (Discrete Event Simulation) - REQUIRED\n",
    "- Complete Tutorial 1 (Adding Space)\n",

    "**What You'll Build:**\n",
    "A spatial SIR epidemic model where agents move on a grid each tick (ABM), but infections and recoveries are handled as discrete events (DEVS), with performance comparisons and visualization."

    "## Recap: Pure DEVS vs Hybrid Models\n",
    "\n",
    "In Tutorial 11, we learned pure discrete event simulation with `DEVSimulator`:\n",
    "- Float-based continuous time (0.0, 1.3, 2.7, 5.2, ...)\n",
    "- Only scheduled events execute\n",
    "- Perfect for queuing systems, arrivals, service processes\n",
    "\n",
    "**Limitation**: No automatic tick-based agent activation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When Do We Need Hybrid Models?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes we need both approaches:\n",
    "- Agents move/interact every tick (spatial dynamics)\n",
    "- But certain state changes happen at specific times (events)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: Epidemic spread\n",
    "- Movement: Every tick (agents walk around)\n",
    "- Recovery: Scheduled event (after random duration)\n",

    "### Exercise 1: SEIR Model\n",
    "\n",
    "Extend the SIR model to SEIR by adding an Exposed state.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "1. Add `EXPOSED` state (between Susceptible and Infected)\n",
    "2. When exposed, schedule infection after incubation period (3-7 ticks)\n",
    "3. Exposed agents are NOT contagious\n",
    "4. Update visualization to show 4 states\n",
    "5. Track epidemic curve for all 4 compartments\n",
    "\n",
    "**Starter Code**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "class PersonSEIR(Person):\n",
    "    EXPOSED = 1\n",
    "    INFECTED = 2\n",
    "    \n",
    "    def expose(self):\n",
    "        if self.state != Person.SUSCEPTIBLE:\n",
    "            return\n",

    "        # TODO: Schedule infection after incubation\n",

    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2: Vaccination Campaign\n",
    "\n",
    "Implement a vaccination campaign starting at tick 50.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "1. 20% of susceptible agents get vaccinated each tick\n",
    "2. Vaccinated agents go directly to `RECOVERED` (immune)\n",
    "3. Stop vaccination when 70% are immune (recovered + vaccinated)\n",
    "4. Compare epidemic curves: with vs without vaccination\n",
    "5. Measure \"lives saved\" (infections prevented)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hints**:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def vaccinate_population(self):\n",
    "    if self.time >= 50 and self.time < self.vaccination_end:\n",

    "### Exercise 3: Dynamic Behavioral Response\n",
    "\n",
    "Agents adapt their behavior based on local epidemic severity.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "1. Agents track infected neighbors in Moore neighborhood\n",
    "2. If >3 infected neighbors: reduce movement (move with 30% probability)\n",
    "3. If >5 infected neighbors: \"self-isolate\" (don't move at all)\n",
    "4. Isolation lasts for 10 ticks, then re-evaluate\n",
    "5. Compare: adaptive vs non-adaptive populations\n",

    "### Exercise 4: Healthcare Capacity Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Model **hospital capacity** and differential outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements**:\n",
    "1. Hospital has limited beds (20% of population)\n",
    "2. Infected agents \"request\" hospital bed\n",
    "3. Agents WITH beds: faster recovery (10-15 ticks)\n",
    "4. Agents WITHOUT beds: slower recovery (15-25 ticks) + mortality risk\n",
    "5. Mortality rate: 5% for untreated, 0.5% for treated\n",
    "6. Track bed occupancy over time\n",
    "7. Implement \"flatten the curve\" interventions\n",
    "\n",
